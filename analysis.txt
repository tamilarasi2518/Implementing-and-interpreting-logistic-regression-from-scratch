Detailed Feature Interpretation

This analysis evaluates feature importance using a logistic regression model
trained on a synthetic dataset generated with make_classification.

Each feature weight indicates how strongly and in what direction a feature
influences the prediction of class 1.

Positive weights → higher feature values increase likelihood of class 1.
Negative weights → higher feature values decrease likelihood of class 1.
