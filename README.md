# Implementing-and-interpreting-logistic-regression-from-scratch
This project guides students to build logistic regression from scratch using Python and NumPy, implementing sigmoid, gradient descent, and tuning hyperparameters. They must test on a Scikit-learn dataset, compare results to the library version, analyze performance differences, and interpret learned coefficients.
